1
first debug i ran into was with the request sending. when testing POST. in the struct i 
bind required elements name, description, locationm datetime. datetime requires specific
input. it should look like this 2024-08-21T14:00:00Z.  if you pass like 2024-20-24 there
will be server side error. 

2
working with database. error was with the variable DB inside initDB function was 
shadowing package level DB variable he DB inside the InitDB function is not the same 
as the DB variable that you want to use across your package, 
so when you try to use DB in other functions (like createTables()), 
it is still nil, leading to a runtime error.

3 
order of calling the functions in the main function. first there was a db caller, then
gin default function. If you try to access the DB variable before it's initialized, 
you'll run into a nil pointer dereference.
